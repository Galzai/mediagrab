Important (for working proof of concept):
-Create search function by media details (show name , episode , etc...)
-Add option to grab magnet or download torrent.

Features:
-More scrapers (or try to implement grabbing torrent data by magnet, will make it possible for user added websites easily).
-Add paramaters to FilterData (codec, uploader, etc).
-Add library for saving latest viewed episode.
-Add function to look for latest episode released for show.
-Add media type selection.
-Add automation for new episode release (e.g if show is released every monday check overy tuesday for torrent.
-Add option to select sites to try and grab media from, check for duplicate results (via identical magnet link).
-Add CLI.
-Add GUI.

Optional (too much of a noob to implement i guess):
-Remove external torrenting software dependency.
